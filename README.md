An encoder/decoder tool for Firefox. Prebuilt versions will be at
http://bigmacintosh.net/f/foxhound-latest.xpi until it's ready for submission
to a.m.o.

Until then, you can use [cfx](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/getting-started-with-cfx.html)
from the Addon SDK to build it if you need to build it yourself.
